# MNIST Classification with PyTorch

This repository contains a PyTorch implementation of a Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) model to classify handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset. The model is trained using a combination of techniques such as batch normalization, dropout, and learning rate scheduling to achieve high accuracy.

## Overview

The goal of this project is to build a deep learning model that can accurately classify handwritten digits (0-9) from the MNIST dataset. The dataset consists of 60,000 training images and 10,000 test images, each of which is a 28x28 grayscale image.

## Model Architecture

The model is a simple Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) with the following structure:

- **Input Layer:** 28x28 pixels, flattened to 784 features
- **Hidden Layer 1:** Fully connected layer with 128 neurons, followed by Batch Normalization, ReLU activation, and Dropout (50%)
- **Hidden Layer 2:** Fully connected layer with 64 neurons, followed by Batch Normalization, ReLU activation, and Dropout (30%)
- **Output Layer:** Fully connected layer with 10 neurons (one for each digit class)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/TitoLanna/A.I-Practice-codes-/blob/main/Multi-Layer%20Perceptron.ipynb
   cd mnist-classification-pytorch
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

   Make sure you have the following packages installed:
   - `torch`
   - `torchvision`
   - `matplotlib`
   - `numpy`

3. To run the code on a GPU, ensure that you have CUDA installed and PyTorch configured to use it.

## Usage

To train the model, simply run the script:

```bash
python train.py
```

The script will:
- Load the MNIST dataset.
- Split the training data into training and validation sets.
- Train the MLP model for a specified number of epochs.
- Validate the model on the validation set after each epoch.
- Test the model on the test dataset and display the accuracy.

### Parameters

- `BATCH_SIZE`: Number of samples per batch (default: 64).
- `NUM_EPOCHS`: Number of epochs to train the model (default: 20).
- `DEVICE`: Specify whether to use 'cuda' (GPU) or 'cpu' for training.

## Results

After training, the model achieves high accuracy on both the validation and test datasets. Below are some key metrics from the training process:

- **Training Accuracy:** 98.40%
- **Validation Accuracy:** 97.80%
- **Test Accuracy:** 98.26%

A sample of the training process:

```plaintext
Epoch: 1/20 | Train: 94.76% | Validation: 95.53%
Epoch: 2/20 | Train: 95.84% | Validation: 96.52%
...
Epoch: 20/20 | Train: 98.40% | Validation: 97.80%
Test accuracy: 98.26%
```
